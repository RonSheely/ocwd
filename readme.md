## What does `ocwd` do?
`ocwd` is a command line utility that downloads resources from any [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/) course to any storage path provided by you. The resources are available in the public domain and MIT reserves all rights to the content. This tool simply scrapes the OCW website for resources and offers a simple and easy way for downloading any course resource for offline use.
## Installation
`ocwd` is a [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) script, therefore, it works wherever PowerShell works. Currently, PowerShell is available on both Windows and UNIX (that covers both Linux and MacOS) systems. Read their [installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.3) for more information on this.

Paste the following in your PowerShell terminal to install `ocwd` to your system.
```ps1
Install-Script -Name ocwd
```
